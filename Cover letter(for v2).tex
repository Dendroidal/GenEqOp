\item clarified diagram (3.1)

\item clarified 2 sentences after Remark 3.13

\item Fixed some typos in Lemma 2.21
\end{itemize}


\section{Not changed}

\begin{itemize}

\item[34.] We are unsure how the notation in 
Remark \ref{LRROOTMAP REM} clashed with the notation in 
\eqref{OGDEF EQ} and Definition \ref{ROOTPULL DEF}.

\end{itemize}

\section{Direct response to comments}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[3.] We replaced ``iff'' with ``if and only if''
	in the expository/conversational parts of the paper, 
	but left it as ``iff'' in the technical parts (theorems, proofs, remarks), as we find it improves readability of many statements.
	
	Our previous experience is that ``iff'' seems to be an acceptable shorthand in publication, and that is our preference,
	but we do not have a strong objection to changing it.
	
	\item[8.] The meaning of the term ``family''
	was already spelled out the first time the term was used.

	\item[15.] Clarified references and definition of semi-model structures we require for this paper.
              The notion of semi-model structure we use was originally introduced in the unpublished \cite{Spi01} as a \textit{$J$-semi model structure},
              which agrees with the notion of a semi-model structure from \cite{WY18} for $\mathcal M = \**$.
              For non-trivial $\mathcal M$, the notions in \cite{Spi01} and \cite{WY18} do not agree;
              this is discussed further in comment (71.).

	\item[16.] Concerning Theorem \ref{MAINEXIST2 THM},
	we are unsure as to why 
	having different $\mathcal{F}$ determine
	different categories makes our result
	``differ from the classical case''. 
	Partial genuine operads $\mathsf{Op}_{\mathcal{F}}(\mathcal{V})$
	work the same way as partial coefficient
	systems $\mathcal{V}^{\mathsf{O}_{\mathcal{F}}^{op}}$,
	with both being described as the subcategories
	of $\mathsf{Op}_{G}(\mathcal{V})$ and
	$\mathcal{V}^{\mathsf{O}_{G}^{op}}$
	that ``take the value $\emptyset$ away from $\mathcal{F}$''.
	Maybe we are thinking of different ``classical cases''? 
	
	\item[21.] we are unaware of any reference for Props. 
	\ref{FIBERKANMAP PROP} and \ref{GROTHSTAB PROP}.
	Certainly these results are elementary enough that they are probably already known (especially Prop. \ref{GROTHSTAB PROP}),
	but the results were new to us. 
	
	\item[24.] While these results are straightforward 
	and their proofs are generic, 
	we are unaware of any references for Propositions \ref{MONADADJ1 PROP}, \ref{MONADADJ PROP}, \ref{MONADICFUN PROP}. The likely references we are familiar with, such as 
	\cite{Bo94} or \cite{Ri17} do not quite discuss the framework we need.
	As with Props. 
	\ref{FIBERKANMAP PROP} and \ref{GROTHSTAB PROP},
	these results were new to us.
	
	\item[27.] In the intro to \S \ref{PLANAR_SECTION} we
	clarified that $\mathsf{F}^G$ denotes $G$-objects in $\mathsf{F}$,
	which is not a skeletal category (rather, it is the subcategory of $\mathsf{F}^G$ consisting of \emph{order preserving maps} that is skeletal).
	%
	This may seem pedantic,
	but it took us a fair amount of time to figure out the best level of ``skeletalness'' for the categories 
	$\Omega, \Phi, \mathsf{F}, \Omega_G, \cdots$, 
	which seems to be to demand that only planar/ordered maps are skeletal.
	
	\item[31.] the $\mathsf{O}^p_G$ notation in 
	Convention \ref{PLANARCONV CON}
	was a typo and should have been simply $\mathsf{O}_G$.
	The intended meaning is that we reinterpret totally ordered finite sets as having underlying set of the form
	$\{1<2<3<\cdots <n\}$,
	but this is already built into the definition of 
	$\mathsf{O}_G$ given in the introduction to
	\S \ref{PLANAR_SECTION}.

  \item[33.] Added a justification for 
	the characterization of ``independent maps in $\Omega_G$''
	provided in Remark \ref{INDOMGALT REM}.
	This required adding 
	Proposition \ref{INDMAPCHAR PROP},
	which provides an alternative characterization of \emph{independent maps}
	(than that in \cite[Def. 5.28]{Pe17})
	which is better suited for the discussion in this paper.
	Suitably altered the proof of Proposition \ref{PLANARPULL PROP}
	to refer to Proposition \ref{INDMAPCHAR PROP}
        
	\item[35.] more detail has been added to Example \ref{ROOTPULL EX}, hopefully making it easier to understand 
	how $\tau^{\**}(T)$ and $\pi^{\**}S$ are obtained.
	
	\item[36.] Example \ref{OUTERTREE EX} was added illustrating what outer faces look like pictorially. 
	Phrasing Definition \ref{OUTFACE DEF} 
	in terms of broad posets   
	is important to provide rigorous proofs
	
	\item[39.] Example \ref{PLANAREX EX} had been expanded provide examples of the $e^{\uparrow}$
	and $\underline{e} \leq e$
	notations; this should avoid the confusion concerning 
	Remark \ref{SCTARR REM}
	
	\item[46.] \eqref{PIIDEFDI2 EQ} does not need natural isomorphisms on the left, i.e. the square strictly commutes. The intuition is that since degeneracies merely duplicate one layer of vertex data, they do not change the way the vertex data is planarized. 
	
	\item[51.] 
	{\color{red} Need to revise proof of Lemma \ref{LANPULLCOMA LEM}
	to improve legibility}
	
	the comment preceding Corollary \label{MONDEFCOR COR}
	is indeed meant to refer to Lemma \ref{ROOTFIBPULL LEM}
	rather than Lemma \ref{LANPULLCOMA LEM}.
	The point is that Lemma \ref{ROOTFIBPULL LEM}
	is needed to state Corollary \label{MONDEFCOR COR}
	while 
	Lemma \ref{LANPULLCOMA LEM} is needed to prove it.
	
	\item[54.] concerning weak indexing systems,
	we find that Definition \ref{INDEXSYS DEF}
	is better suited for our purposes in this paper than 
	the definition in \cite{Pe17}; as such, even if we were to use the definition from \cite{Pe17} we would still need to convert it into a formulation better suited for this paper.
	
	On a side note, in the sequels to this paper 
	{\color{red} give references}
	we've been lead to identify further definitions,
	better suited for those papers.
	Personally, I (Luis) am prefer the Segal sieve definition
	
	
	\item[55.] throughout \S \ref{FREE_EXTENSIONS_SECTION}
	we replaced most of the abbreviations of
	$\mathbb{F}_G$ as $\mathbb{F}$ with the use of $\mathbb{F}_G$
	except for those in the long formulas
	\eqref{DOUBAR EQ} and \eqref{FURRES EQ},
	which wouldn't fit in the line and be hard to read otherwise
	(in both cases the abbreviation is mentioned immediately before the equation)

	\item[58.]
	fully spelling out the statement of
	Proposition \ref{PIIPROPAB PROP}
	would amount to an entire page
	consisting of nothing other than a copy of 
	Proposition \ref{PIIPROP PROP}
	with the symbols 
	$\Omega^n_G$
	replaced with 
	$\Omega^{n,s,\lambda}_{G}$ and
	$\Omega^{n,s,\lambda}_{G} \wr (A_j)$
	throughout.
	
	This does not seem like an efficient use of space to us, 
	so we are wondering how much ``spelling out'' seems necessary.
	
	In either case, we spelled out a little more the discussion of the ``excluded cases''.

	\item[62.] 
	In order to better motivate the proof of 
	Proposition \ref{LXP PROP}
	we moved Example \ref{LRP EX}
	(which contains the pictorial description of $\mathsf{lr}_{\mathcal{P}}$) to before the proof,
	and added a brief reminder of the substitution setup in 
	Proposition \ref{BUILDABLE PROP}(iii)
	and Example \ref{GRAFTSUB EX}.

	\item[63.]
	We are not sure what was meant by the comment that
	``the picture in Example \ref{LRP EX} seems backward from
	Example \ref{REGALTERNMAP EX}''.
	Since $\mathsf{lr}_{\mathcal{P}}$
	is covariant, the two arrows should go in the same direction.
	Further, we expanded the informal description
	of $\mathsf{lr}_{\mathcal{P}}$
	in Example \ref{LRP EX},
	which should help clarify what this functor does.
	
	\item[64.]
	In Corollary \ref{KANRED COR} the sentence immediately after ``$\widehat{\Omega}^e_G \hookrightarrow \Omega^e_G$ is
	$\mathsf{Ran}$-initial over $\Sigma_G$''
	is the definition of $\mathsf{Ran}$-initial,
	so it seems the comment was already addressed.
	In addition, Lemma \ref{MINUS_LAN_FINAL_LEMMA} where ``$\mathsf{Ran}$-initial'' also appears was altered to refer to Corollary \ref{KANRED COR}.
	\item[82.] the proof of Prop. \ref{POWERF PROP} is terse since the overall argument is technically identical to that in the proof of [22, Thm 1.2] (one just modifies the hypothesis to get different conclusions).
	We would be happy to add extra detail if deemed necessary. 

	\item[66.] we are not sure what the intended issue with 
	``$lr(S)$ in 5.61'' 
	(during the proof of Lemma \ref{MINUS_LAN_FINAL_LEMMA})
	was meant to be.
	Nonetheless, we altered 
	Lemma \ref{MINUS_LAN_FINAL_LEMMA}
	to highlight that the forgetful functors to $\Sigma_G$
	are denoted $\mathsf{lr}$
	
	\item[67.] the short answer is that \eqref{EXTTREEFOR EQ} does define $\tilde{N}$.
	Ultimately, \eqref{EXTTREEFOR EQ} is just a slight restatement of Corollary \ref{ESTABDESC COR}, which builds 
	$\tilde{N}$ by applying Proposition \ref{RANTRANS PROP}.
	
	To avoid this confusion,
	we've added Remark \ref{TILNUNPACK REM} 
	which describes $\tilde{N}$ in fairly explicit terms
	(we had avoided including this since most of this explicit description isn't actually needed for our purposes,
	but maybe this will help clarify how 
	Proposition \ref{RANTRANS PROP} is being used),
	and revised the first few lines of 
	\S \ref{FILTRATION_SECTION} accordingly	

	
	\item[68.] As requested, additional detail was added to the proof of
	Proposition \ref{FILTINTALT PROP}

	\item[69.]
	To make the forward references less confusing, 
	we made sure that all forward references to results take place in
	Remark \ref{GEN_FGTRIGHT_REM},
	which was expanded accordingly.

	\item[71.] 
	Concerning the semi-model structure analogue of
	\cite[Thm. 11.3.2]{Hi03}
	(mentioned in the proof of Theorems \ref{MAINEXIST1 THM} and \ref{MAINEXIST2 THM}):
	
	Unfortunately, Spitzweck's notion
	of $J$-semi-model structure over $\mathcal M$ in \cite{Spi01}
	does not quite match the definition
	of semi-model structure
	we are using
	(which is based on more recent accounts e.g. \cite{Fre09,WY18}),
	so while \cite[Thm. 2]{Spi01}
	is indeed an analogue of \cite[Thm. 11.3.2]{Hi03},
	it features some extra technical conditions concerning cofibrancy.
	Namely, the \emph{definition} of the $J$-semi-model structure over $\mathcal M$ from \cite{Spi01}
	includes the assumption
	that transferred cofibrations between cofibrant objects forget to cofibrations.
	For example,
	in the context of Theorem \ref{MAINEXIST2 THM},
	this would mean that cofibrations between cofibrant objects in the \emph{projective} 
	model structure on $\mathsf{Op}_G$
	forget to cofibrations in the 
	\emph{projective} 
	model structure on $\mathsf{Sym}_G$.
	However, our argument instead shows that they forget to 
	cofibrations in the \emph{genuine} 
	model structure on $\mathsf{Sym}_G$
	(i.e. the model structure transferred from the left half of \eqref{MAINPFADJ EQ}).
	And since the projective model structure has more cofibrant objects but less weak equivalences, 
	this is sufficient to follow the argument in 
	\cite[Thm. 11.3.2]{Hi03} mutatis mutandis,
	which is what \cite[Thm. 2]{Spi01} does,
	\emph{except} \cite[Thm. 2]{Spi01}
	is using different cofibrancy assumptions than we are.

%	Spitzweck's notion of a $J$-semi-model structure from \cite{Spi01} includes as part of the \textit{definition}
%        that transfered cofibrations with cofibrant domain forget to cofibrations;
%        more recent accounts (e.g. \cite{Fre09,WY15}) prove this as a property of well-behaved semi-model categories,
%        as do we in our key Lemma \ref{MAINLEM LEM}).
%        After accounting for this difference (i.e. modifying the hypotheses to remove the condition on $\mathbb F I$-cells), the analogue result is \cite[Thm. 2]{Spi01}.
%        The relevant observation is that the proof of \cite[Thm. 2]{Spi01} is completely analogous to the proof of \cite[Thm. 11.3.2]{Hi03}.
        
	For clarity, we hence spelled out the ``natural analogue result'' of \cite[Thm. 11.3.2]{Hi03} we had in mind
	and added a footnote mentioning \cite[Thm. 2]{Spi01} as yet another variant of \cite[Thm. 11.3.2]{Hi03}.
	
	
	
        
	\item[72.] the argument in the proof of Theorem \ref{MAINEXIST2 THM}
	concerning the case with $\mathcal{F}$
	a general weak indexing system has been entirely rewritten and hopefully made clearer
	
	\item[73.] the paragraph explaining how the proof of 
	Theorem \ref{MAINEXIST1 THM}
	follows by adapting the proof of 
	Theorem \ref{MAINEXIST2 THM}
	has been expanded
	({\color{red} should add extra remarks somewhere about how the existence of the needed filtrations does not require $\V$ to have diagonals})

        \item[74.] Added short explanations of the double coset formulas used in 
        Propositions \ref{FGTLEFT PROP} and \ref{BIQUILLENG PROP}.

        \item[78.] added Remark \ref{CSPP_REM}, which compares the cofibrant symmetric pushout powers condition to other model categorical conditions of a similar form, and describe the utility of our definition.

        \item[79.] added Definition \ref{GENUINEMS_DEF} explicitly defining the genuine, $\F$, and projective model structures,
              and added language in \S \ref{PUSHPOW SEC} to emphasize which we are using.
	
	\item[81.] We are not sure what was meant by the 
	``where did the wreath product come from?'' comment
	concerning the proof of Proposition \ref{POWERF PROP},
	but we added further explanation concerning
	\eqref{GENCOFWR EQ} which might clear the confusion
	
	\item[84.] Further detail was added 
	to Remark \ref{UNPACKINGLTIMES REM} to better explain the given intersection
	
	\item[86.] we shrunk Remark \ref{WRONGSTRAT REM} 
	to focus on the comparison between Proposition \ref{AUTTCOFPUSH PROP} and \cite[Lemma 5.9]{BM08},
	and on which parts of our proof are similar and which are new,
	rather than go into detail as to why one can't simply adapt the proof of \cite[Lemma 5.9]{BM08} directly
	(the counter-example we built 
	is too complicated to be worth including,
	involving the group 
	$\Sigma_3 \wr \Sigma_2$ and 
	significant discussion of indexing systems)	
	
	\item[88.] the discussion concerning Proposition \ref{FIXPT PROP} has been significantly revised: 
	extra context concerning $\iota_{\**}$ was added beforehand; the proposition was restated to allow for an easier proof; and the proof was simplified and clarified
	
	\item[91.] the proof of Lemma \ref{MAINLEM LEM} has been revised at several points to clarify how the parallel argument connects
	\eqref{COFADJ2 EQ} and \eqref{FGTFUNC EQ}
	
	\item[92.] we're a little confused with regards to the comment that the proof Theorem \ref{MAINQUILLENEQUIV THM}
	would have needed to mention Kan complexes. As Kan complexes are simply the fibrant objects in $\mathsf{sSet}$,
	any necessary claims concerning Kan complexes
	are packaged instead in terms of fibrant objects;
	we've added an explanation as to why
	$\iota_{\**}$ detects fibrations
	
	\item[96.] Reworded and clarified the part of the proof of 
	Proposition \ref{BARCOF PROP}
	concerning the modified cube 
	$\tilde{\mathcal{X}}^n$
	and the associated appeal to 
	Lemma \ref{MONOCUBE LEM}(a).
	
	\item[99.] the superscript notation $(-)^{\downarrow j}$
	in Lemma \ref{UNDERLEFTADJ LEM}
	is not a typo, but is instead our chosen notation for the right adjoint to $(-)\downarrow j$.
	The proof as been expanded to include more detail.
\end{itemize} 

\section{Slight math fixes}

\begin{itemize}
	\item started fixing $G \times \Sigma_n$ 
	to 
	$G^{op} \times \Sigma_n$
	({\color{red} still incomplete})
	
	\item added Remark \ref{IOTAFUNSALT REM},
	which provides alternative formulas for
	$\iota_{\**}$
	
	\item[28.] In the intro to \S \ref{PLANAR_SECTION}
	we replaced the reference to 
	\cite[Prop. 5.47]{Pe17}
	with a reference to 
	\cite[Def. 5.44]{Pe17},
	which in hindsight is indeed closer 
	to the formulation of the pullback \eqref{OGDEF EQ}.
	The connection to \cite[Prop. 5.47]{Pe17}
	does indeed require a little argument concerning Grothendieck constructions {\color{red} which can be found in one of our sequel papers}, 
	but we know of no canonical source.
	
	\item[47.] condition (c) in Proposition \ref{PIIPROP PROP}
	was fixed; the previous formulation was technically incorrect since the given permutations
	permute blocks in $V_G(T_k)$,
	and though the way the blocks
	are permuted depends only on 
	$T_0 \to T_1 \to \cdots T_i$,
	the size of the blocks also depends on the map 
	$T_i \to T_k$ 
	
	\item[85.] changed the $G \times \phi$ notation 
	to $id_G \times \phi$ in Remark \ref{LRLEFTQUILLEN REM}
	
	\item[89.] slightly modified the natural isomorphisms and added reference to Proposition \ref{MONAD_COMPARISON_PROP} 
\end{itemize}
