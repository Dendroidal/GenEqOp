\abstract{We build a new algebraic structure, which we call genuine equivariant operads, which can be thought of as a hybrid between equivariant operads and coefficient systems.
We then prove an Elmendorf type theorem stating that equivariant operads, with their graph model structure, are equivalent to genuine equivariant operads with their projective model structure.

As an application, we build explicit models for the $N_{\infty}$-operads of Blumberg and Hill.
