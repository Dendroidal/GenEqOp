\abstract{We build new algebraic structures, which we call genuine equivariant operads, which can be thought of as a hybrid between equivariant operads and coefficient systems.
We then prove an Elmendorf type theorem stating that equivariant operads, with their graph model structure, are equivalent to genuine equivariant operads with their projective model structure.

As an application, we build explicit models for the $N_{\infty}$-operads of Blumberg and Hill.

\section{Planar and tall maps}

\subsection{Planar structures}


Throughout we will work with trees possessing \textit{planar structures} or, more intuitively, trees embedded into the plane.

Our preferred model for trees will be that of broad posets first introduced by Weiss in \cite{We12} and further worked out by the second author in \cite{Pe16b}. We now define planar structures in this context.


\begin{definition}\label{PLANARIZE DEF}
	Let $T \in \Omega$ be a tree. A \textit{planar structure} of $T$ is an extension of the descendancy partial order $\leq_d$ to a total order $\leq_p$ such that: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Planar}: if $e \leq_p f$ and $e \nleq_d f$ then 
		$g \leq_d f$ implies $e \leq_p g$.
	\end{itemize} 
\end{definition}


\begin{example}
An example of a planar structure on a tree $T$ follows, with $\leq_r$ encoded by the number labels.
\[
	\begin{tikzpicture}[grow=up,auto,level distance=2.1em,
	every node/.style = {font=\footnotesize,inner sep=2pt},
	dummy/.style={circle,draw,inner sep=0pt,minimum size=1.75mm}]
		\node at (0,0) {$T$}
			child{node [dummy] {}
				child[sibling distance = 9em]{node [dummy] {}
					child[sibling distance = 2.5em]{
					edge from parent node [near end,swap] {$11$}}
					child[level distance=2.5em]{
					edge from parent node [very near end,swap] {$10$}}				
					child[sibling distance = 2.3em]{
					edge from parent node [near end] {$9$}}
				edge from parent node [swap] {12}}
				child[level distance =2.5em]{
				edge from parent node [swap] {$8$}}
				child[sibling distance = 8em]{node [dummy] {}
					child[sibling distance =3em, level distance = 1.5 em]{node [dummy] {}
					edge from parent node [swap] {$6$}}
					child[sibling distance = 1.5em]{node [dummy] {}
						child[sibling distance =1em]{
						edge from parent node [swap,near end] {$4$}}
						child[sibling distance =1em]{
						edge from parent node [near end] {$3$}}
					edge from parent node [very near end,swap] {$5$}}
					child[sibling distance =1.5em]{node [dummy] {}
					edge from parent node [very near end] {$2$}}
					child[sibling distance =3em,level distance =1.5em]{node [dummy] {}
					edge from parent node {$1$}}
				edge from parent node {$7$}}
			edge from parent node [swap] {$13$}};
	\end{tikzpicture}
\]
Intuitively, given a planar depiction of a tree $T$, $e \leq_d f$ holds when the downward path from $e$ passes through $f$
and $e \leq_p f$ holds if either
$e \leq_d f$ or if the downward path from $e$ is to the left of the downward path from $f$ (as measured at the node where the paths intersect).
\end{example}



Intuitively, a planar depiction of a tree amounts to choosing a total order for each of the sets of \textit{input edges} of each node (i.e. those edges immediately above that node).

While we will not need to make this last statement precise, we will nonetheless find it convenient to show that Definition \ref{PLANARIZE DEF} is equivalent to such choosing total orders for each of the sets of input edges.
To do so, we first introduce some notation.


\begin{notation}\label{INPUTPATH NOT}
	Let $T \in \Omega$ be a tree and $e \in T$ and edge. We will denote
	\[ I(e) =\{f \in T \colon e \leq_d f \} \]
and refer to this poset as the \textit{input path of $e$}.
\end{notation}

We will repeatedly use the following, which is a consequence of \cite[Cor. 5.26]{Pe16b}.

\begin{lemma}\label{INCOMPNOTOP}
If $e \leq_d f$, $e \leq_d f'$, then $f,f'$ are $\leq_d$-comparable. 
\end{lemma} 

\begin{proposition}\label{INPUTPATHS PROP}
	Let $T \in \Omega$ be a tree. Then
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(a)] for any $e \in T$ the finite poset $I(e)$ is totally ordered;
		\item[(b)] the poset $(T,\leq_d)$ has all joins, denoted $\vee$. In fact, $\bigvee_{i} e_i = \min (\bigcap_{i} I(e_i))$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	(a) is immediate from Lemma \ref{INCOMPNOTOP}.
To prove (b) we note that 
	$\min (\bigcap_{i} I(e_i))$ exists by (a), and that this is clearly the join $\bigvee{e_i}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{notation}
	Let $T \in \Omega$ be a tree and suppose that $e <_d b$. We will denote by $b^{\uparrow}_e \in T$ the predecessor of $b$ in $I(e)$.
\end{notation}


\begin{proposition}\label{INPUTPREDECESSORPROP PROP}
Suppose $e,f$ are $\leq_d$-incomparable edges of $T$ and write $b= e \vee f$. Then
\begin{itemize}
\item [(a)] $e <_d b$, $f<_d b$ and $b^{\uparrow}_e \neq b^{\uparrow}_f$;
\item [(b)] $b^{\uparrow}_e, b^{\uparrow}_f \in b^{\uparrow}$. In fact $\{b^{\uparrow}_e\} = I(e) \cap b^{\uparrow}$,
$\{b^{\uparrow}_f\} = I(f) \cap b^{\uparrow}$;
\item[(c)] if $e' \leq_d e$, $f' \leq_d f$ then 
$b = e' \vee f'$ and $b^{\uparrow}_{e'} = b^{\uparrow}_{e}$, $b^{\uparrow}_{f'} = b^{\uparrow}_{f}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}


\begin{proof}
(a) is immediate: the condition $e = g$ (resp. $f = g$) would imply $f \leq_d e$ (resp. $e \leq_d f$)
while the condition $b^{\uparrow}_e = b^{\uparrow}_f$ would provide a predecessor of $b$ in $I(e) \cap I(f)$. 

For (b), note that any relation $a <_d b$ factors as 
$a \leq_d b^{\star}_a <_d b$ for some unique $b^{\**}_a \in b^{\uparrow}$, where uniqueness follows from Lemma \ref{INCOMPNOTOP}. Choosing $a=e$ implies $I(e) \cap b^{\uparrow} = \{b^{\**}_e\}$ and letting $a$ range over edges such that $e \leq_d a <_d b$ shows that $b^{\**}_e$ is in fact the predecessor of $b$.

To prove (c) one reduces to the case $e'=e$, in which case it suffices to check $I(e) \cap I(f') = I(e) \cap I(f)$. But if it were otherwise there would exist an edge $a$ satisfying
$f' \leq_d a <_d f$ and $e \leq_d a$, and this would imply $e \leq_d f$, contradicting our hypothesis.
\end{proof}



\begin{proposition}
\label{TERNARYJOIN PROP}
Let $c = e_1 \vee e_2 \vee e_3$.
Then $c = e_i \vee e_j$ iff $c^{\uparrow}_{e_i} \neq c^{\uparrow}_{e_j}$.

Therefore, all ternary joins in $(T,\leq_d)$ are binary, i.e.
\begin{equation}\label{TERNJOIN EQ}
	c = e_1 \vee e_2 \vee e_3 = e_i \vee e_j
\end{equation}
for some $1\leq i <j \leq 3$, and
(\ref{TERNJOIN EQ}) fails for 
 at most one choice of $1\leq i <j \leq 3$.
\end{proposition}


\begin{proof}
If $c^{\uparrow}_{e_i} \neq c^{\uparrow}_{e_j}$ then
$c = \min\left(I(e_i) \cap I(e_j)\right) = e_i \vee e_j$, whereas the converse follows from Proposition \ref{INPUTPREDECESSORPROP PROP}(a).

The ``therefore'' part follows by noting that 
$c^{\uparrow}_{e_1}$, $c^{\uparrow}_{e_2}$, $c^{\uparrow}_{e_3}$
can not all coincide, or else $c$ would not be the minimum of
$I(e_1) \cap I(e_2) \cap I(e_3)$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{notation}
	Given a set $S$ of size $n$ we write
	$\textsf{Ord}(S) \simeq \mathsf{Iso}(S,\{1,\cdots,n\})$. We will usually abuse notation by regarding its objects as pairs $(S,\leq)$ where $\leq$ is a total order in $S$.
\end{notation}


\begin{proposition}\label{PLANARIZATIONCHAR PROP}
	Let $T \in \Omega$ be a tree. There is a bijection
	\begin{equation}\label{PLANAR EQ}
	\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 0.5em]
		\{\text{planar structures }(T,\leq_p)\} \ar[r] &
		\prod_{(a^{\uparrow} \leq a) \in V(T)} \mathsf{Ord}(a^{\uparrow}) \\
		\leq_p \ar[mapsto]{r} & (\leq_p|_{a^{\uparrow}})
	\end{tikzcd}	
	\end{equation}
\end{proposition}


\begin{proof}
We will keep the setup of Proposition \ref{INPUTPREDECESSORPROP PROP} throughout: $e, f$ are $\leq_d$-incomparable edges and we write $b = e \vee f$. 

	We first show that (\ref{PLANAR EQ}) is injective, i.e. that the restrictions $\leq_p|_{a^{\uparrow}}$ determine if 
	$e <_p f$ holds or not.
If $b^{\uparrow}_e <_p b^{\uparrow}_f$, the relations
$e \leq_d b^{\uparrow}_e <_p b^{\uparrow}_f \geq_d f$
and Definition \ref{PLANARIZE DEF} imply it must be $e <_p f$.
\[
	\begin{tikzpicture}[grow=up,auto,level distance=1.9em,
	every node/.style = {font=\footnotesize,inner sep=2pt},
	dummy/.style={circle,draw,inner sep=0pt,minimum size=1.75mm}]
		\node at (0,0) {}
			child{node [dummy] {}
				child[sibling distance = 9em]{node [dummy] {}
					child[sibling distance = 2.5em]{
					edge from parent node [near end,swap] {}}
					child[level distance=2.5em]{
					edge from parent node [near end,swap] {$f$}}				
					child[sibling distance = 2.3em]{
					edge from parent node [near end] {}}
				edge from parent node [swap] {$b^{\uparrow}_{f}$}}
				child[level distance =2.1em]{
				edge from parent node [swap] {}}
				child[sibling distance = 8em]{node [dummy] {}
					child[sibling distance =3em, level distance = 1.5 em]{
					edge from parent node [swap] {}}
					child[sibling distance = 1.5em]{node [dummy] {}
					edge from parent node [very near end,swap] {}}
					child[sibling distance =1.5em]{
					edge from parent node [very near end] {$e$}}
					child[sibling distance =3em,level distance =1.5em]{node [dummy] {}
					edge from parent node {}}
				edge from parent node {$b^{\uparrow}_e$}}
			edge from parent node [swap] {$b$}};
	\end{tikzpicture}
\]
Dually, if $b^{\uparrow}_f <_p b^{\uparrow}_e$ then 
$f <_p e$. Thus 
$b^{\uparrow}_e <_p b^{\uparrow}_f \Leftrightarrow e <_p f$ and hence (\ref{PLANAR EQ}) is indeed injective.

To check that (\ref{PLANAR EQ}) is surjective, it suffices (recall that $e,f$ are assumed $\leq_d$-incomparable) to check that
defining $e \leq_p f$ to hold iff $b^{\uparrow}_e < b^{\uparrow}_f$ holds in $b^{\uparrow}$ yields a planar structure.

Antisymmetry and the total order conditions are immediate, and it thus remains to check the transitivity and planar conditions.
Transitivity of $\leq_p$ in the case $e' \leq_d e <_p f$ and the planar condition, which is the case $e <_p f \geq_d f'$, follow from Proposition \ref{INPUTPREDECESSORPROP PROP}(c). Transitivity of $\leq_p$ in the case $e <_p f \leq_d f'$
follows since either $e \leq_d f'$ or else $e,f'$ are $\leq_d$-incomparable, in which case one can apply \ref{INPUTPREDECESSORPROP PROP}(c) with the roles of $f,f'$ reversed.

It remains to check transitivity in the hardest case, that of 
$e <_p f <_p g$ with $\leq_d$-incomparable $f,g$.
We write $c = e \vee f \vee g$.
By the ``therefore'' part of Proposition \ref{TERNARYJOIN PROP}, either
\begin{inparaenum}
	\item[(i)] $e \vee f <_d c$, in which case 
	Proposition \ref{TERNARYJOIN PROP}
	implies 
	$c^{\uparrow}_e = c^{\uparrow}_f$ and transitivity follows;
	\item[(ii)] $f \vee g <_d c$, which follows just as (i);
	\item[(iii)]  
$e \vee f = f \vee g =c$, in which case 
$c^{\uparrow}_e <
c^{\uparrow}_f <
c^{\uparrow}_g $ in $c^{\uparrow}$
so that $c^{\uparrow}_e \neq c^{\uparrow}_g$ and by Proposition \ref{TERNARYJOIN PROP} it is also 
$e \vee g = c$ and transitivity follows.
\end{inparaenum}
\end{proof}



\begin{remark}
	Definition \ref{PLANARIZE DEF} readily extends to forests $F \in \Phi$. The analogue of Proposition \ref{PLANARIZATIONCHAR PROP} then states that the data of a planar structure is 
equivalent to total orderings of the nodes of $F$ together with a total ordering of its set of roots.
Indeed, this follows by either adapting the proof above or by noting that planar structures on $F$ are clearly in bijection with planar structures on the join tree $F \star \eta$ 
(cf. \cite[Def. 7.44]{Pe16b}), which adds a single edge $\eta$ to $F$, serving as the (unique) root of $F \star \eta$.
\end{remark}

\begin{convention}\label{PLANARCONV CON}
	From now on, we will write $\Omega$ (resp. $\Omega_G$) to denote a model for the category of trees (resp. $G$-trees) where
\begin{itemize}	
	\item each object (i.e. tree) is equipped with a planar structure;
	\item morphisms ignore the planar structure;
	\item there is exactly one representative of each planarization, i.e. the identities are the only isomorphisms that preserve the planar structure.
\end{itemize}
\end{convention}

\begin{remark}\label{CONCRETETREE REM}
	The reader desiring extra concreteness is welcome to think of the objects of $\Omega$, $\Omega_G$ as consisting of planarized tree structures on one of the sets 
	$\underline{n} = \{1,2,\cdots,n\}$
such that the planarization $\leq_d$ is the canonical total order. Some trees depicted in this convention follow.

\end{remark}
We note that $T_1$ and $T_2$ are isomorphic and, moreover, they encode the only two isomorphism classes of planar structures on the their underlying dendroidal set, so that no other object of $\Omega$ is isomorphic to them. $C$ and $U$, on the other hand, are isomorphic to no other object of $\Omega$, since the  planarizations of the underlying broad posets sets are unique up to isomorphism. 

One drawback of the concrete convention 
illustrated in (\ref{PLANAROMEGAEX1 EQ}), 
however, is that discussion of subfaces of trees becomes awkward, since one can not then technically regard them as subobjects. To avoid this issue, we will often regard the objects of $\Omega$ as equivalence classes of trees with planarizations 
(with no ambiguity resulting since representatives are related via unique isomorphisms).
Moreover, this is particularly convenient when discussing $G$-trees, as it otherwise the task of depicting the $G$-action becomes cumbersome. For some examples, (and recalling that the numbering of the edges as in (\ref{PLANAROMEGAEX1 EQ}) is superfluous, in the sense that it is already encoded in the planar picture itself), we note that for $G=\mathbb{Z}_{/3}$ the orbital representation on the left below encodes the two isomorphic objects of $\Omega_G$ on the right 
(which are isomorphic to no other object of $\Omega_G$).
\[
	\begin{tikzpicture}[grow=up,auto,level distance=2.1em,every node/.style = {font=\footnotesize},dummy/.style={circle,draw,inner sep=0pt,minimum size=1.75mm}]
		\node at (0,0) {}
			child{node [dummy] {}
				child{
				edge from parent node [swap] {$a+G$}}
			edge from parent node [swap] {$b+G/G$}};
		\node at (5,0) {$T_1$}
			child{node [dummy] {}
				child[level distance=1.7em,sibling distance = 2.75em]{
				edge from parent node [swap] {$a+2$}}
				child{
				edge from parent node [swap, near end] {$a+1$}}
				child[level distance=1.7em,sibling distance = 2.75em]{

			edge from parent node [swap] {$b$}};
		\node at (8.5,0) {$T_2$}

Similarly, for $G=\mathbb{Z}_{/2}$, the orbital representation on the left represents the two $G$-trees presented.
